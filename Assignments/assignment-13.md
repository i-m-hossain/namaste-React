# Time for the test(Theory)

## What are different types for testing?
    1. Manual testing
    2. Automated testing
    3. End to end testing 
    4. Unit testing
    5. Integration testing
    6. Performance testing
    7. Smoke testing

## What is Enzyme?
    Enzyme is another testing library for testing react. But it is currently replaced by React testing library

## Enzyme vs React Testing Library
React-testing-library makes testing compared to Enzyme, a lot easier with all of its helper methods for querying and the matchers from jest-dom.

However, there are limitations to react-testing-library, such as not being able to access component state (which might be intentional because you shouldnâ€™t be doing that in theory).

Besides Enzyme is not updated with latest React version and also React testing library is recommended by React

## What is Jest and why do we use it?
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.
